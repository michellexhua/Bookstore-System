# Bookstore-System
Bookstore System developed by: H. Arshad, A. Aldoreh, O Alchalabi, C. Horne, C. Bialkowski, M. Hua (myself), T. Ivue, and H. Stam.

Developed additional features to the bookstore while applying agile methodologies such as scrum and extreme programming techniques. The techniques that were most focused on were: frequent standup meetings, user stories, pair programming, and test driven development (black-box and white-box testing).
The features implemeneted were registration, login, search, add/remove, order and a dashboard.

The bookstore system was developed with Visual Studio and coded in C#, SQL and .XAML. The group also utilized Clubhouse for project management.
